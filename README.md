# RoombaWho
<p>My goal in creating and sharing this OSS with that world is to turn the automated home cleaning business on its head! Please find the instructions below and enjoy</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project is a simple one. There are two files in the RoombaWho directory.</p>

- main.js
- input.txt

<p>the main.js file is our only file for the project. It will look in the directory that you place it in for an input.txt file. It then will iterate through this file, identifying room dimensions, dirt plots, and navigation instructions. The output of which will indicate the RoombaWhos final position, in the room, and how many plots of dirt it cleaned.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Please make sure you have Node installed on your machine.
